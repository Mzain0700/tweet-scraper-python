He is not at all known outside a small amount of the left-wing in the UK, but he has the audacity to claim that the British authority should arrest an American citizen.  I mean, I don't know if Jonathan Freedman knows his history, I assume he does.   He's a relatively intelligent man.   But he should know that America fought quite a significant war in order that American citizens would not, in fact, be under the writ of British law.   And thank goodness Elon Musk isn't.  And thank goodness he has the guts to continue, like a number of the rest of us, to say, what is the truth.  The reason you see so much of the media running against Elon Musk at the moment, is they recognize that his platform, Twitter, is beating all of them, or most of them, in all the stakes.  And that's very scary for some of these old media who can't keep up, and don't have very many readers, like the Guardian.  It's perfectly possible, that people like me, billionaires like Elon Musk, will be able to get through this era and will survive it.  And I certainly plan to, and I'm sure and know that Musk does as well.  But what about, as you say, the person who does not have the platform that I have or the means that Elon Musk has?  What about them?  As it's happening all the time at the moment in the UK, police forces that have not solved one burglary in recent years are knocking on people's doors and arresting them for Facebook posts, for retweeting things.”  Source: Interview with @DouglasKMurray  on Sky News, August 15, 2024",Mario Nawfal,20300,140,4570,805,"Aug 16, 2024 · 5:06 PM UTC"

83,https://twitter.com/farzyness/status/1792294458660151331#m,"The US has a fertility crisis, but we can easily fix it.  The fertility rate in the US is below replacement rate, at 1.78 births per woman in 2023. This is the lowest rate on record. This means that if we continue on, the US population will progressively get older and smaller.  This will dramatically reduce the size of our economy, decrease innovation, and will burden younger folks with the costs and time associated with taking care of the elderly.  There will be too much time and money spent on keeping society from collapsing vs investing time and money to grow it. We will all die pooping our pants with almost no one in sight.  It will suck. Really bad.  However, the fix is much simpler than we all realize, and all we have to do is cater to our primal instincts by putting in place incentives that will tickle it.  One of our largest primal instincts is the need for safety and security. In today's world, the single biggest tool that we use to achieve that is money.  Money for food, shelter, water, transportation. You name it.  Money rules everything.  Knowing this, all we would have to do is creative an incentive that will pay people to have children.  ""Show me the incentive and I'll show you the outcome"", the great late Charlie Munger once said.  And thus, my very simple proposal to increase the fertility rate in the US, which will in turn ensure the country will continue to grow and flourish, is the following:  Increase the child tax credit from $2,000 to $6,500 per child.  This will make it so that the bottom 80% of income earners in the US that raise at least 3 children will pay $0 in federal taxes. This equals to roughly 84 million families.  Having 3 children will ensure that population growth continues. Plus, the more kids folks wanna have, the more they'll benefit, especially as they continue to work to create more value.  Now, let's get into the numbers to see how much this would cost.  See below breakdown of federal taxes paid by each family income bracket, broken down by 20% segments (bottom 20%, second 20%, etc.)  This program, as long as folks are having 3 children, will cost $611 billion to fund the bottom 80%, and another $334B from the top 20%.  This totals to $946 Billion.  Let's look at how the US Government spends its money today so we can gauge how realistic this is. Here's a breakdown of the US Government expenses in 2023:  To summarize: - $3.8 Trillion in Mandatory expenses (set by law like Social Security, Medicare, etc.) - $1.7 Trillion in Discretionary (fluctuates annually based on lawmaker approvals) - $659 Billion in Interest payments on US debt  Now, here's a breakdown of where the US gets its tax revenue from to fund all these programs. These are the taxes all of us pay, including corporations:  $2.2T of the $4.4T in revenue comes from individual taxes, which this program would impact directly. These taxes would essentially be cut in half, lowering our total tax revenue from $4.4T to $3.5T.  However, even in our current state, we needed to take borrow $1.7 TRILLION in debt to pay for the shortfall vs the US budget. We made $4.4 trillion in revenue, yet we spent $6.1 trillion.  We overspent by the same amount as our Discretionary spending, and our interest payments are about to become as big as our Defense budget.  Cutting another $946 billion in revenue would increase the deficit by the same amount, making it $2.7 Trillion. However, here's my very simply solution to not only keep the deficit the same with this new program, but likely lowering it over time:  Cut the US Federal Budget of $6.1 Trillion by 20% across the board, down to $4.88 Trillion. This would instantly save $1.22 trillion per year in expenses, fully funding this $946 Billion program within the current budget parameters, and additionally lowering our deficit from $1.7 Trillion to $1.4 Trillion.  New Revenue: $3.5 Trillion (down 20%) New Expenses: $$4.88 Trillion (down 20%) New Deficit: $1.4 Trillion (down 18%)  This proposal is based on the following premise:  - This is the most existential issue facing our country - period. It's not our eternal rivalry with Russia, our battle with China's ambitions with Taiwan, or our battle with terrorists. It's us dying out because we aren't making enough of us. Period. Full stop. Not even close. - The US government is incredibly bloated and inefficient. You know this. I know this. People who work in Government know this. Our politicians know this. To think that we couldn't somehow keep the lights on and remove decades of dead weight by cutting expenses by 20% is silly. Elon Musk removed 85%+ of Twitter, and we're all still here folks... and private companies are already more efficient than Government entities. Imagine how much waste there is. - The massive boom in population growth in the US would bring with it a gigantic economic boom. More people = more demand. More demand = more business volume. More business volume = more money spent. More money spent = more taxes paid. It will start a giant flywheel of revenue for the US government. This might even help us offset our deficit in the long term. - It will strategically place the US as the only Western Nation that has a booming population, instead of one that has a shrinking one. Every single major western economy, including some eastern ones like China, are fighting this literal death spiral. - People will finally go back to feeling like starting a family isn't a giant financial burden on their everyday lives, and the population would regain trust in the Government once again, due to its incentives being fully aligned with those of the people. Have more kids = make more money. Super simple. - The simplicity of this proposal will make it easier for the American public to buy in. No complicated loopholes. No catering to an income bracket or another. No special interests involved. A simple alignment of incentives between the US government and the American public.

It is about a year since Elon hired her to run the company.  The article mostly focuses on financial performance.  In my view, X has become a pleasure to use this year.  I was not a fan of Twitter and generally stayed away from it.  But this year, it has become a daily go to for me.  I like the transparency and the opportunities to say what is on my mind and gauge what the reactions may be.  While not all of the responses are pleasant, at least they are unfiltered and do capture the ethos of free speech that Elon wanted to bring to life.  I’m curious what others think?  1).

In just 15 days, SpaceX identified and resolved the issue and now has returned to flight. It’s difficult to contextualize how impressive that is. Even working through an anomaly investigation, that turnaround far exceeds the regular launch frequency of every other launch provider in the world.  It is also an important reminder that spaceflight is never easy and never routine. Pushing the boundaries of physics, spaceflight is unforgiving, and the smallest hardware deficiency can wreak havoc to an entire mission. The small part that failed on the July 11 mission was part of a redundant sensor system, but the downstream effect of this failure prevented a clean ignition for the second stage’s second burn, resulting in the stage unable to circularize its orbit and deploy the Starlink satellites. The short-term resolution was to simply delete the part!  Even as rocket launches become more and more frequent and garner less and less fanfare, there remains countless hard-working individuals and teams making that so. Congrats to all on the hard work.

457,https://twitter.com/Intrstngthings/status/1816508824028872933#m,"The Oort Cloud lies far beyond Pluto and the most distant edges of the Kuiper Belt. While the planets of our solar system orbit in a flat plane, the Oort Cloud is believed to be a giant spherical shell surrounding the Sun, planets and Kuiper Belt Objects. It's like a big, thick bubble around our solar system, made of icy, comet-like objects. The Oort Cloud's icy bodies can be as large as mountains – and sometimes larger.  Because the orbits of long-period comets – which take more than 200 years to orbit the Sun – are so extremely long, scientists suspect that the Oort Cloud is the source of most of those comets. For example, comet C/2013 A1 Siding Spring, which made a very close pass by Mars in 2014, will not return to the inner solar system for about 740,000 years.  The distance from the Sun to the Oort Cloud is so enormous that it’s useful to describe it not in the more common units of miles or kilometers, but astronomical units. One astronomical unit (or AU) is the distance between Earth and the Sun. Pluto’s elliptical orbit carries it as close as 30 AU from the Sun, and as far as 50 AU. The inner edge of the Oort Cloud, however, is thought to be between 2,000 and 5,000 AU from the Sun. The outer edge might be 10,000 or even 100,000 AU from the Sun – that's one-quarter to halfway between the Sun and the nearest neighboring star.

However, we will look back at this time, when doctors and “professionals” pressured parents to perform surgery and give hormones to *children*, with great shame and regret.    The detransition stories are just starting, and they are devastating.   These stories always include the parents and children being bullied into making irreversible decisions.  They make decisions they don’t fully understand but are told will solve a complex problem. However, in most cases, this “problem” is solved best with love, compassion, counseling, and time.   Adolescence is challenging 100% of the time, as we all have experienced.   Imagine your darkest and most confusing moment as a teenager. Now, imagine a group of authorities telling you that your gender confusion causes all your pain and that you can solve all of that pain with surgery and hormones.   Now imagine the state of California acting to hide this child’s struggle from their parents — and then pursuing a gender transition covertly with the child.   That is the crime that is happening right now.   We don’t let kids smoke vapes or drink until they are fully informed of the ramifications of those decisions as adults  — yet we put them on puberty blockers and have them do surgery to change their gender as teenagers?   What is the rush?   There isn’t one, so they tell the parents, “Your child will kill themselves if they don’t transition.”  This is pure evil.   There are no parents who agree with this, there are only bullied and confused parents… and that needs to end now.   I say this with unlimited compassion and love for any child or family dealing with gender dysphoria.

669,https://twitter.com/BillAckman/status/1812308245194682749#m,"I am going to formally endorse @realDonaldTrump. I came to this decision some time ago as many @X followers have already understood from my supportive posts of Trump and my criticisms of @POTUS Biden.   The reason why I have not yet formally done so is that I want to explain my thinking in detail and address the arguments put forth by others against Trump. I want to make the case thoughtfully and convincingly.   Today, when one announces an intention to support Trump, Biden supporters who know me tend to assume that I have lost it. I assure you that I have made this decision carefully, rationally, and by relying on as much empirical data as possible.   It will take a long-form post to explain my thinking.  I might even break my own record. I just haven’t had the time nor felt the urgency to write the post as we are still a few months from the election.   I am explaining my conclusion now in response to many questions I have received on the topic so that I am formally on the record.   You of course don’t need to care about my opinion so feel free not to read my post when it appears. That said, I believe the upcoming presidential election is one of the most consequential elections in my lifetime so I am taking the proper time to articulate observations that I will share widely and for which I assume an important responsibility.   I have had the benefit of spending a few hours recently with President Trump so I will have some first hand observations to share.   As always, I respect everyone’s right to form and share their own views on this important topic.   Please keep an open mind on the upcoming presidential election. Bear in mind that your views on Trump have likely been dramatically affected if you have sourced your info on Trump from mainstream media or friends or family who have relied on mainstream media as a source of knowledge.   We have all recently learned in the starkest manner (the debate) how we cannot rely on the MSM as our source of truth on the ultimate political question.   Remember, media organizations are like sports teams that run plays chosen by their owners and executed by the coaches they hire.

844,https://twitter.com/balajis/status/1806773841395675218#m,"CHEVRON DOMINANCE  Technology is about to accelerate. Because Chevron deference is over. And regulators can't just make up laws anymore. So, countless new startups just became feasible. This is often spoken about in the abstract, so let's do three examples and two visuals.  THREE EXAMPLES  1) Genomics. Did Congress explicitly give FDA authority to regulate genetic tests in a bill like Kefauver-Harris (1962) or PDUFA (1992)? No, it did not. But in the early 2010s, FDA attacked 23andMe and forced them to take personal genomic tests offline. Implicitly, this was under Chevron.  2) Nuclear power. Did Congress explicitly give EPA and NRC the authority to implement ALARA? No, it did not. But these agencies came up with this ""as low as reasonably achievable"" standard, forcing nuclear energy to become as expensive as other energy sources by spending all the cost-savings on ""safety."" Implicitly, this was under Chevron too.  3) Cryptocurrency. You guessed it. Did Congress explicitly give the SEC authority to regulate crypto? No, it did not. Cryptocurrencies didn't exist when the 1933 and 1934 acts were written. However, the SEC says it has regulatory authority over crypto, even when Congress is deliberating on bills to the contrary. Implicitly, that claim of SEC authority too was under Chevron.  In other words: if a regulator can't point to the law that gives them the power, they may not have the power. And you might be able to win in a court of law.  So! For technology, the overruling of Chevron could literally reopen innovation in the physical world. This is on par with the 1991 opening of the Internet to commercial traffic. It deprecates the 20th century regulatory state. All the safety theater and security theater that they optimize for sounding good while actually being bad now has to face judicial scrutiny.  TWO VISUALS How to visualize something as abstract as Chevron reversal? Well, Chevron is the company on which the 1984 Chevron deference case is actually based. And its logo had the arrows pointed down. But now that Chevron has been reversed, we're headed up.   And that's one way to visualize what reversal means: from Chevron deference to Chevron dominance. Because rule-of-law now dominates the lawless regulatory state. If the regulator isn't specifically authorized by statute, they can't invent some regulation to stop your innovation.  But there's a second way to visualize the reversal of Chevron: regulators just got disarmed, in the most literal sense. Because ultimately a regulation is a threat of state force. If you disobey one of a regulator's made up rules, they eventually get a cop to point a gun at you, implicitly or sometimes very explicitly.  ^ The photo above is from the 2010 FDA raid on Rawesome Foods for selling raw milk to club members that consciously opted in to eating and drinking foods of their own choice. This may have also been done under Chevron deference because FDA only has the right to regulate interstate commerce, and not commerce within one state (which is all that Rawesome was apparently doing at that time).  To be clear, I don't have a position on raw milk other than I do think people should be able to choose their own foods. In their lawsuit against the Farm To Consumer Legal Defense Fund, FDA strongly disagreed, contending that ""there is no generalized right to bodily and physical health"" and you ""do not have a fundamental right to obtain any food they wish.” These are real quotes from the now-defanged regulators; see the PDF link below.  Anyway — now you get a sense of how big a deal the Chevron reversal is, and how out of control regulators can get. The Chevron reversal strips regulators of the ability to make up random rules. It calls all their existing made-up rules into question. And it gives you the power to ask where in the law it says they can make up some new rule.  You know that saying — the only way they can stop you is to shoot you? Well, now they can't shoot you as easily. So we're going from Chevron deference to Chevron dominance.   I can already feel the T-levels across tech increasing.",Balaji,13235,421,3320,613,"Jun 28, 2024 · 7:37 PM UTC"
